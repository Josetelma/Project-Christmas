<h1>Merry Christmas☃️</h1>
<br>

<h2>Creating a Christmas tree using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a fun and educational project.
The HTML structure is made up of several layers positioned absolutely to form the shape of a tree. CSS styles the tree and defines the colors and layers of the foliage. JavaScript to add interactivity and animations.</h2>
